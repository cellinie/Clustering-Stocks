# Clustering Stocks
Imagine we are given a massive dataset containing various stocks with different financial metrics. Portfolio managers often need to devise strategies to build risk-adjusted portfolios that minimize risk for a given level of return. To achieve this, they must select stocks that are either uncorrelated with each other or find similar stocks to gain adequate exposure to specific market segments. In this context, we use an unsupervised learning method to analyze unlabeled data.
